                    As an imtrovert, my Covid-19 experience was not much different from my daily routine, minus the going to school part. With no school 
                    for a month, I got the time to learn about and appreciate theh existence of th eother beings in my household; they are pretty decent people. 
                    Unfortunately my Mom was one of the many that got laid off because of the pandemic, because she works in the hotel industry and well, no flights are 
                    allowed in the country. Thankfully, my sister was one of the few privileged to have a job that allows her to work from home. We live in 
                    a community where the houses are so close together that we are literally unable to go outside in the yard, so being inside was our only option. Because 
                    of this I ofcourse was unable to visit my family members afraid that stepping outside would resulyt in me catching the virus.
                    We found numerous shows on netflix that we bonded over and we have had food events on every Friday, where we would make fast food dishes that 
                    we would usually buy on a weekend. We started bulk buying because of the panic, out of fear that we would not be able to get anything when we did 
                    go to the supermarket. Shopping was a serious, having little panic attacks everytime I had to use public transportation or when someone 
                    stood too close to me in a line, or worse, someone sneezing or coughing anywhere near me. With the resumption of classes in an online format, evrything 
                    actually remained the same for me since most of my classes were streamed to begin with, save for the unnecessary amount of work being awarded 
                    to us by the lecturers. Thankfully I am yet to be personally affected by the virus and I hope it stays that way.

            <h3>My Experience through a series of photographs and videos</h3><br>
            <p>In the images below I share my experience while shopping in mega mart, where everyone in line ha dto be 6 feet a part, 
              we had to have our temperatures checked before entering and before we could get inside completely we had to use the sanitizers 
              provided at the entrance. I also shared some photos from my family friday food escapdes, where we made fast food at home, so we would not put 
              ourselves at risk buy buying outside food.

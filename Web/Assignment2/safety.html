            <h3>Stay Home</h3><br>
            <div class="row text-center">
             
                <p>
                    Unlike me, a lot of persons love being outside. They enjoy the thrill of being on the road with friends making memories that 
                    will last a lifetime. However, Covid-19 does not allow anyone to maintain their normal lifestyles, styaing home is a must if 
                    you want to combat the virus. If the streets can be avoided, stay home! Only leave the house for necessities and make sure to 
                    follow proper protocol when reentering your home to make sure you're not taking the virus with you. 
                </p>

            <h3>Shower regurlarly</h3><br>
            <div class="row text-center">
                <p>
                    I'm assuming everyone bathes at least once everyday, well if not, now is the time. This is especially necessary after going on the 
                    road. This ensures that you wash away any particles you might have brought in with you, from your whole body, especially places you 
                    would not expect them to be. 
                </p>

            <h3>Wash outside clothes immediately</h3><br>
            <div class="row text-center"> 
                <p>
                    As soon as you get home from outside, no matter how short of a time it was, be sure to wash the clothes you take off immediately. If not 
                    immediately, at least ensure that you store it away from anything else until it is time for laundry.
                </p>
                
            </div><br>  
            <h3>Keep your hands washed and sanitized</h3><br>
            <div class="row text-center"> 
                <p>
                    Always, always, always rememeber to wash your hands, after any and everything. After touching any surfaces, especially 
                    those outside of your home, please rememeber to sanitize your hands if you do not have access to a sink or soap to get your 
                    hands washed. Also rememeber to sanitize surfaces in your home, especially those frequently touched, for example door knobs.
                </p>
                
            </div><br>  
            <h3>Social Distancing</h3><br>
            <div class="row text-center">
                <p>
                    As an introvert, I always find myself at leats 8 feet apart from people especially in a line. Now the norm has been set to 
                    6 feet which means I am 10 feet apart(*inserts laughter here*). Also stay away from your family members and friends whom you do 
                    not reside as way lessening the risk for everyone.
                </p>
                
            </div><br>
            <h3>Wear your masks</h3><br>
            <div class="row text-center">
                <p>
                    Never, ever, ever, leave your house without a mask, especially since masks are mandatory in public spaces. If you can not afford 
                    to buy one, grab some material and make one, as long as it is sturdy enough to keep those particles away. 
                </p>

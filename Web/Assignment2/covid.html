               <p>Covid-19 more commonly known as the Wuhan Corona Virus, is beleived by scientist to have originated in Wuhan China, yet 
                it has somehow found its way on at least 6 of Earth's continents. It is said to affect ones respiratory functions It has caused a global pandemic, resulting in several industries
                such as tourism to come to a standstill. People all over the world have been locked in their homes for months afraid of stepping oustide 
                and contracting the virus. Over 2 million cases worldwide, and thousands of deaths within the first half of 2020 and maybe even as early 
                as 2019, the corona virus is beleived by many to be the modern day plague. It spreads quickly and easily as several articles published by the World Health Organization 
                (WHO) and the Centers of Disease Control (CDC) would suggest. Children are at home as schools are locked until further notice, millions are unemployed while some enjoy the 
                privilege of working from home and the fearless medical, first response and other essential professionals risk there health daily as they try to combat 
                this virus. While the WHO and CDC try to make a vaccine as they learn new facts about the virus, people will have to maintain the guidelines they 
                have provided to help prevent the spread.

            <h3>Covid-19 in the Caribbean</h3><br>
            <div class="row text-center">
                <p>
                    The Caribbean was definitely not exempt from the travelling plans of the novel Corona virus, though slowly for some, it surely spread making
                    its presence and forging an impact that would last for months. For COuntries like the Dominican Republic ehich was the first Caribbean Territory
                    to record a case of the Covid-19 virus, the virus spread like wildfire with cases doubling and sometimes trippling in numbers daily. 
                    Jamaica another that was affected started out with slow cases, they recorded less than 60 cases within the first month the virus was on 
                    the island. However, due to an outbreak in a call center, there was a surge in the number of cases recorded, sending their total to 500+ cases. 
                    Exams regulated for all CARICOM members had to be postponed as schools have been closed for over 2 months. Schools such as the University 
                    of the West Indies have put into place forums to facilitate online learning. Cuba, an island well known for its medical expertise has not 
                    only reached out to help other islands but is also in the bid to provide a cure for the virus as well.

            <h3>Covid-19 in North America</h3><br>
            <div class="row text-center"> 
                <p>
                    The United States of America much like anything always wants to be number one, unfortunately fo rthem, they now have more cases than any 
                    other country in the world. They have almost a third of the world's corona virus cases, and places like New York, which was the epicenter
                    of the virus in the USA has been under lockdown for several months. They along with other states, however, have residents who are unemployed
                    and tired of being in lockdown. All over the country Americans are protesting to be let out and have their economy restarted. While others are 
                    against this idea as they fear a second wave of the virus might affect them even before the first an dcurrent wave is finished. This 
                    fear comes especially because it was not long ago that New York had to employ the use of trucks as travelling morgues to store the high 
                    number of dead bodies.

            <h3>Covid-19 in Europe</h3><br>
            <div class="row text-center"> 
                <p>
                    Europe became the epicenter of the virus after it left China with countries like Italy having the highest number of new cases and deaths recorded in 
                    a day. Soldiers had to go house to house to pick up the bodies of the deceased who did not have the chance to get medical care because there
                    just were not enough medical professionals there to handle the number of patients. Like Italy other european countries followed with a similar routine in the number of cases and deaths. The United King is said to be 
                    responsible for the majority of cases in the Caribbean and New York, since patient 0 for those places were travellers from the UK or 
                    other european countries. The number cases might have lessened in europe, but pandemic remains as significant as it first arrived.

            <h3>Covid-19 in Asia</h3><br>
            <div class="row text-center">
                <p>
                    Asia, more specically China is where it is said to have official started. The story is similar to every outbreak that has ever happened 
                    one person contracts it and then it spreads almost endlessy. For Wuhan China, people have been in quarantine since about late 2019 or 
                    the early parts of January 2020. Around April the number of cases being recorded there had dropped to as low as 8 one day. The quarantine had 
                    been lifted and persons were getting ready to resume normalcy when the second wave hit. Now, millions of people have to go back into lockdown 
                    as even more cases are emerging. In other countries like South Korea, about more than 70% of the cases can be linked to one patient, while other countries like 
                    India have allowed law enforcement to discipline those who breach quarantine rules through lashes.
